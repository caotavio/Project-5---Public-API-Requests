# Project-5---Public-API-Requests
Page that uses fetch api to make a public api request

A page that uses fetch api to make a public api request from a database, converts the information to JSON
and randomly generate 12 employee cards with basic information. Those cards when clicked open a modal window
that displays additional employee information such as birthday and full address. The cards are dinamically
added with javaScript and uses jQuery for cleaner code.
